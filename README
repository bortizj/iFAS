What is iFAS?

******************************************iFAS*****************************************************

The image Fidelity Assessment Software (iFAS) is a software tool designed to assist researchers, engineers and other users in the process of image fidelity assessment. iFAS provides easy access to a range of state-of-the-art methods as well as intuitive visualizations that aid data analysis. The software is freely available to all for non-commercial use. iFAS includes a range of common mechanisms for image fidelity assessment including computation of fidelity measures on a single pair of images and/or in a full database (this is done using our own class object imageSet),
visualization of pixel-wise image differences and histogram of the image differences, scatter plots and correlation analysis between human scores and objective measures. Furthermore, iFAS is designed with the purpose of making the interface user friendly even for adding new functionality (by modifying or extending the source code). This user interface takes away the interaction of the user with the code, reducing the time spent on the fidelity assessment phase of a merging technology and/or benchmarking of image processing algorithms. From beta version we have added the imageSet object which is used to manage all the computation between images while the user interface is used for displaying purposes. This gives the possibility of using the imageSet object without our UI.

System requirements

******************************************iFAS*****************************************************

The minimum system requirements to run iFAS are:
- 1000 MHz processor 
- 2048 MB RAM 
- 400 MB of hard-drive space (or USB stick)
- 3D Acceleration Capable Video card with at least 512 MB
- The recommended operating system is GNU Linux Ubuntu 14 or higher. 

iFAS is developed using Python 2.7; GTK+; Scipy 0.17.0 together with its core packages, particularly, NumPy 1.11.0, Matplotlib 1.5.1, pandas 0.17.1, nose 1.3.7, Cython 0.25.1 and Scikits 0.12.3; PIL 1.1.7; PyGObject (aka PyGI) 3.20.0; Pycairo 1.10.0; PyWavelets  0.5.0. Therefore, those packages need to be pre-installed before running iFAS. Opencv bindings are also necessary. In Ubuntu Linux, the following commands install the required packages if necessary (please look at your system configuration):

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install --upgrade python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas ipython ipython-[notebook] python-sympy python-nose python-pip python-dev python-gi build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg8-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libdc1394-22-dev libv4l-dev
$ sudo pip install -U scikit-image
$ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran 
$ sudo -H pip install Cython
$ sudo apt install aptitude
$ sudo aptitude install python-gi-cairo
$ sudo apt autoremove
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
$ git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib.git
$ cd ~/opencv
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
