Python virtual environment configuration
---------------------------------------
Install anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/
conda create --name ifas_venv python pip numpy pandas tk matplotlib
conda activate ifas_venv
conda install -c anaconda scipy
conda install -c anaconda opencv
conda install -c conda-forge pywavelets
# To use your environment while iFAS is running
conda deactivate
# Or use the requirements file
conda create --name ifas_venv --file requirements.txt

# Create Button
To create a new database select the folder with a set of source images
Then select the destination folder and give a name to your database
Note: the source image has a settings file named db_settings with the following rows
row one is the name of the distortion which should be at add_distortions.py
row two is the levels of distortion in comma separated values

# Run Button
Select the measures in the measures pane.
Click Run and select the folder of the set of source and test images. 
A popup window with progress bar shows the progress of the computations.
Results in a csv file on the database folder named *_ifas_ouput.csv

# Load Button
To load existing database select the folder of the set of source and test images 
as given by the create button or using the following folder hierarchy:
1. MainDatabase folder contains 
	1.1. subfolder per reference image. The folder is named as the reference image
		1.1.1 it contains the reference image with the set of test images png format.
	1.n+1. csv file with the results given by run ifas database named *_ifas_ouput.csv

For example:
1. my_db
	1.1. my_source_0
		1.1.1. my_source_0.png
		1.1.2. my_test_0.png
		1.1.3. my_test_1.png
		...
	1.2. my_source_1
		1.1.1. my_source_1.png
		1.1.2. my_test_0.png
		1.1.3. my_test_1.png
		...
	...
	1.n. my_db_ifas_ouput.csv
	
# Correlation button
After loading a database, it is possible to compute correlations between the 
measures available in the csv file that should be together with your database 
(see Run button for details). The results is the legend of the measures together 
with a heat map of the correlations. The correlations are exported as csv files 
in the database directory: *_ifas_dist_corr.csv, _ifas_pearson.csv, 
_ifas_spearman.csv and _ifas_tau.csv. In the correlations pane information related 
to the top five correlations is shown.

# Scatter plot button
After loading a database, it is possible to display a scatter plot of the data. 
A new window appear with one of the measures in the x axis and the another measure 
in the y axis (the axis are labeled correspondly to the measure). The plot 
can be controlled using the left, right, up and down keys in order to change 
between the different measures.

# Bar plot button
After computing correlations between the measures, it is possible to display a 
bar plot of the correlations of each measure agaianst the target variable.
In iFAS the atarget variable is always the last column of the csv file of the 
database. This column can be modified by the user to include for instance 
human evaluations.

# Box plot button
After loading a database, it is possible to show the correlation against the 
target variable for each measure in form of the box plot. Each box represents 
the correlation distribution for each source variable.
