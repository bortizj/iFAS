Software description
--------------------
The image Fidelity Assessment Software (iFAS) is a software tool designed 
to assist researchers, engineers and other users in the process of image 
fidelity assessment.
 
iFAS provides easy access to a range of state-of-the-art methods as well 
as intuitive visualizations that aid data analysis. The software is freely 
available to all for non-commercial use. 

iFAS includes a range of common mechanisms for image fidelity assessment 
including computation of fidelity measures on a single pair of images and/or 
in a full database, visualization of pixel-wise image differences and 
histogram of the image differences, scatter plots and correlation analysis 
between human scores and objective measures.
