Python virtual environment configuration
---------------------------------------
Install anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/
Open Anaconda prompt 
$ conda create --name ifas_venv python=3.8 pip scipy pandas tk matplotlib pywavelets
$ conda activate ifas_venv
$ conda install -c anaconda opencv
# To use your environment while iFAS is running
Then install the iFAS package
$ pip install -e D:\gitProjects\iFAS
conda deactivate

# Create Button
To create a new database select the folder with a set of source images
Then select the destination folder and give a name to your database
Note: the source image has a settings file named db_settings with the following rows
row one is the name of the distortion which should be at add_distortions.py
row two is the levels of distortion in comma separated values

# Process Button
Select the measures in the measures pane.
Click Process and select the folder of the set of source and test images. 
A popup window with progress bar shows the progress of the computations.
Results in a csv file on the database folder named *_ifas_ouput.csv

# Load Button
To load existing database select the folder of the set of source and test images 
as given by the create button or using the following folder hierarchy:
1. MainDatabase folder contains 
	1.1. subfolder per reference image. The folder is named as the reference image
		1.1.1 it contains the reference image with the set of test images png format.
	1.n+1. csv file with the results given by run ifas database named *_ifas_ouput.csv

For example:
1. my_db
	1.1. my_source_0
		1.1.1. my_source_0.png
		1.1.2. my_test_0.png
		1.1.3. my_test_1.png
		...
	1.2. my_source_1
		1.1.1. my_source_1.png
		1.1.2. my_test_0.png
		1.1.3. my_test_1.png
		...
	...
	1.n. my_db_ifas_ouput.csv
	
# Correlation button
After loading a database, it is possible to compute correlations between the 
measures available in the csv file that should be together with your database 
(see Process button for details). The results is the legend of the measures together 
with a heat map of the correlations. The correlations are exported as csv files 
in the database directory: *_ifas_dist_corr.csv, *_ifas_pearson.csv, 
*_ifas_spearman.csv and *_ifas_tau.csv. In the correlations pane information related 
to the top five correlations is shown.

# Scatter plot button
After loading a database, it is possible to display a scatter plot of the data. 
A new window appears with one of the measures in the x axis and another measure 
in the y axis (the axis are labeled correspondingly to the measure). The plot 
can be controlled using the left, right, up and down keys in order to change 
between the different measures.

# Bar plot button
After computing correlations between the measures, it is possible to display a 
bar plot of the correlations of each measure against the target variable.
In iFAS the target variable is selected in the Modeling pane.

# Box plot button
After loading a database, it is possible to show the correlation against the 
target variable for each measure in form of the box plot. Each box represents 
the correlation distribution when the correlation is independetly computed for 
each source image. 

# Regression plot button
It is possible to show the results of the regression model after its 
optimization. A new window appear with one of the measures in the x axis and 
the target measure in the y axis (the axis are labeled correspondly to the 
measure). The plot can be controlled using the left, right keys in order to 
change between the different measures.

# Navigation buttons on top of the images
Left or Right to move across the reference image (left pane) and the test 
images (right pane).

# Model combobox 
To select between the available regression models

# Target
The dependent or target variable for the regression model

# Parameters ini
The set of parameters to be used as initial guess in the optimization algorithm

# Optimize
This button starts the optimization of the selected model using the selected 
target variable. Also activates the regression plot.
